# 2048-server
This is a fork of Gabriele Cirulli's [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) that works as a game server. The purpose of this project is to provide a common game logic and interface for different client-side game playing algorithm implementations, as part of a challenge competition between a couple of friends and me.

## Contributing
This project was made for fun and for the aforementioned challenge. Feel free to use it or fork it, though I probably won't be accepting or expecting contributions for it.
